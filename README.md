## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js with Vue Router for navigation.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (to store user and job data).
- **Authentication**: Keycloak (to handle secure user authentication).
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modular component-based styling.

## Project Structure

Here’s an outline of the project directory structure:


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
- **Vue CLI**: Install Vue CLI globally.
  ```bash
  npm install -g @vue/cli


## Usage

### Pages and Functionalities

- **Home**: Provides a general overview of the platform.
- **About**: Detailed information about Visa Connection and its purpose.
- **Jobs**: A job search page with filters for employment type, visa sponsorship, and other criteria.
- **Immigration Assistance**: A personalized recommendation tool that allows users to enter preferences and receive information on suitable immigration destinations.
- **Sign In & Sign Up**: User authentication forms (integration with Keycloak and backend API under development).

### Route Configuration

Each page in the app is accessible through Vue Router. Here’s a list of routes available:

- `/home` - Home page
- `/about` - About page
- `/jobs` - Job search page
- `/immigration-assistance` - Immigration assistance form and recommendations
- `/signin` - Sign-in form
- `/signup` - Sign-up form

## API Endpoints (Planned)

*Note: API endpoints will be documented in detail once the backend is fully developed.*

Example endpoints to be included:

- `GET /api/jobs`: Retrieve a list of job postings.
- `POST /api/auth/login`: User authentication with Keycloak.
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `GET /api/immigration-recommendations`: Get country recommendations based on user preferences.

## Keycloak Integration

The app will use Keycloak for secure user authentication. Once integrated, the app will handle authentication flows, including sign-up, sign-in, and token management for secured access.

### Keycloak Setup (Pending)

The Keycloak configuration will be added to `keycloak.js` and initialized in `main.js` for seamless authentication within the application. Instructions for Keycloak setup and integration will be provided upon backend completion.

- **Advanced Filtering and Search**: Implement more complex filtering capabilities for job search and immigration recommendations.
- **Interactive UI Enhancements**: Modernize the UI with responsive design, animations, and accessible components.
- **User Profiles**: Allow users to save preferences, search history, and bookmark jobs or countries of interest.
- **Integration with External APIs**: For example, country information, cost of living indexes, and job market insights.
